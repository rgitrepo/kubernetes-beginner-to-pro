In Istio, **ztunnel** is a component that plays a central role in the **Ambient Mesh** architecture, specifically in the **sidecarless** mode of operation.

### What is ztunnel?

**ztunnel** (zero trust tunnel) is a lightweight, purpose-built proxy responsible for handling **Layer 4** traffic in the **Istio Ambient Mesh**. It acts as the core data plane component when operating without sidecars. Unlike traditional sidecar proxies (like Envoy), ztunnel is deployed as a centralized component and is responsible for ensuring secure, encrypted communication between services.

### ztunnelâ€™s Role in Ambient Mesh

In the **Ambient Mesh** mode of Istio, which is **sidecarless**, the network traffic between services is handled by ztunnel rather than individual Envoy sidecar proxies for each service. Here's how it fits into the architecture:

- **Layer 4 Traffic Handling**: ztunnel is responsible for routing and securing Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) traffic between services. It provides basic routing and mTLS encryption between workloads.
- **Centralized Architecture**: Unlike the sidecar model where each service has its own Envoy proxy, ztunnel works centrally and handles traffic for multiple workloads, reducing the overhead and complexity of sidecar injection for each service.
- **Security**: ztunnel ensures zero-trust security by encrypting communication between services using mTLS.
- **Performance**: By removing the need for a sidecar proxy per service, ztunnel reduces resource overhead (CPU and memory), improving performance and scalability, especially in resource-constrained environments.

### Does ztunnel Replace Envoy?

No, **ztunnel** does not completely replace Envoy. In **Istio Ambient Mesh**, ztunnel handles Layer 4 (L4) traffic, while **Envoy is still used for Layer 7 (L7) traffic** such as HTTP, gRPC, and other application-layer protocols. When deeper control over application-layer traffic is required (such as routing, retries, or fault injection), Istio still uses Envoy proxies.

### Is ztunnel Still Used?

Yes, **ztunnel** is actively used in Istio's Ambient Mesh architecture. It is designed to work in conjunction with the rest of the Istio control plane to provide **Layer 4 security** and **basic traffic management** without the overhead of sidecars. As Istio evolves, ztunnel remains a key part of its sidecarless architecture for organizations looking to reduce the complexity and resource usage of their service mesh.

### Summary

- **ztunnel** is a key component in Istio's **Ambient Mesh** architecture, specifically for handling **Layer 4** traffic in a **sidecarless** deployment.
- It provides **mTLS** and routing for Layer 4 traffic between workloads.
- **Envoy** is still used for **Layer 7** traffic, meaning ztunnel and Envoy work together in sidecarless architectures depending on the traffic layer.
- ztunnel reduces the overhead of sidecars, making Istio more efficient in large or resource-constrained environments.
