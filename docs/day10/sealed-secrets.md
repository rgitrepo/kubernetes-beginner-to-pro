### Introduction to Sealed Secrets
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

In Kubernetes, managing sensitive data like passwords, API keys, and tokens securely is crucial. By default, Kubernetes Secrets are only encoded using Base64, making them susceptible to unauthorized access if not handled carefully. This tutorial covers Sealed Secrets, an extension to Kubernetes Secrets that ensures they are encrypted and can only be decrypted by the cluster.

---

### Setting Up Sealed Secrets
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### Prerequisites
Before setting up Sealed Secrets, ensure you have:
- A Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- `kubectl` installed and configured to access your cluster.
- Helm installed (for easier installation of the Sealed Secrets controller).

#### Installing Sealed Secrets Controller
The Sealed Secrets controller is responsible for decrypting Sealed Secrets in your cluster. Follow these steps to install it using Helm:

1. **Add the Bitnami Repository:**
   ```bash
   helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
   helm repo update
   ```

2. **Install the Sealed Secrets Controller:**
   ```bash
   helm install sealed-secrets bitnami/sealed-secrets --namespace kube-system
   ```

   Verify the installation by checking the pods:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=sealed-secrets
   ```

#### Installing kubeseal CLI
`kubeseal` is a CLI tool used to encrypt secrets before applying them to your cluster.

1. **Download and Install kubeseal:**
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.18.1/kubeseal-linux-amd64
   chmod +x kubeseal-linux-amd64
   sudo mv kubeseal-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kubeseal
   ```

2. **Verify the Installation:**
   ```bash
   kubeseal --version
   ```

### Creating and Encrypting Secrets
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### Creating a Secret
Kubernetes Secrets can be created using various methods. Here, we'll create a generic secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic mysecret --from-literal=key1=myvalue --dry-run=client -o yaml > mysecret.yaml
```

This command generates a YAML file named `mysecret.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysecret
type: Opaque
data:
  key1: bXl2YWx1ZQ==
```

#### Encrypting the Secret Using kubeseal
Next, we encrypt the secret using the `kubeseal` command:

```bash
kubeseal --controller-name=sealed-secrets --controller-namespace=kube-system < mysecret.yaml > sealedsecret.yaml
```

This command produces an encrypted `sealedsecret.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: bitnami.com/v1alpha1
kind: SealedSecret
metadata:
  name: mysecret
spec:
  encryptedData:
    key1: AgA9...
```

---

### Applying Sealed Secrets to a Cluster
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### Creating a Sealed Secret
The `sealedsecret.yaml` file generated in the previous step is now ready to be applied to the Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f sealedsecret.yaml
```

#### Applying the Sealed Secret
Once applied, the Sealed Secrets controller in your cluster will automatically decrypt it and create a corresponding Secret resource. Verify the creation with:

```bash
kubectl get secrets
```

You should see a secret named `mysecret` listed.

---

### Verifying and Consuming Sealed Secrets
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### Verifying the Secret
To verify that the Sealed Secret has been decrypted and stored as a Kubernetes Secret:

```bash
kubectl get secret mysecret -o yaml
```

You should see the decoded data.

#### Consuming Sealed Secrets in a Pod
To consume this secret in a pod, you can mount it as a volume or as an environment variable. Below is an example of consuming the secret as an environment variable:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secret-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nginx
    env:
    - name: MY_SECRET_KEY
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: mysecret
          key: key1
```

Apply the pod definition:

```bash
kubectl apply -f secret-pod.yaml
```

---

### Advanced Use Cases
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### Multiple Secrets in a Single YAML
You can create multiple secrets within a single YAML file. Hereâ€™s an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysecrets
type: Opaque
data:
  key1: bXl2YWx1ZQ==
  key2: bXlzZWNyZXR2YWx1ZQ==
```

Encrypt it with `kubeseal`:

```bash
kubeseal --controller-name=sealed-secrets --controller-namespace=kube-system < mysecrets.yaml > sealedsecrets.yaml
```

#### Rotating Sealed Secrets
Secret rotation is crucial for maintaining security. To rotate a secret:

1. Create a new secret YAML with the updated value.
2. Encrypt it using `kubeseal`.
3. Apply the new Sealed Secret to the cluster.

This process ensures that your application uses the most recent secret value without exposing sensitive data.

### Best Practices and Security Considerations
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

- **Avoid storing plain secrets in version control:** Always use Sealed Secrets for sensitive data.
- **Regularly rotate secrets:** Implement a secret rotation policy to minimize security risks.
- **Limit access to Sealed Secrets:** Ensure that only authorized users can create and apply Sealed Secrets in your cluster.

### Conclusion
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

Sealed Secrets provide a robust way to securely manage sensitive information in Kubernetes clusters. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can confidently encrypt and manage secrets in a secure and scalable manner. Whether you're just starting with Kubernetes or looking to enhance your cluster's security, Sealed Secrets are an essential tool in your DevOps arsenal.
