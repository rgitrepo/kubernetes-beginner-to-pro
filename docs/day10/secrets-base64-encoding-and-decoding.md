### **1. Introduction to Base64 Encoding** <a name="1-introduction-to-base64-encoding"></a>

Base64 encoding is a process used in Kubernetes to convert sensitive data, such as passwords or tokens, into a text format. This process is necessary because Kubernetes Secrets store data in a Base64-encoded format by default. The encoded string is stored securely in Kubernetes but can be automatically decoded when consumed by Pods or applications.

### **2. Storing Base64-Encoded Data in Kubernetes Secrets** <a name="2-storing-base64-encoded-data-in-kubernetes-secrets"></a>

When creating a Secret, the sensitive information must be Base64-encoded before being stored in Kubernetes. You can use the `base64` command to encode your data.

**Example: Base64 Encoding a Password**
```bash
echo -n 'my-sensitive-data' | base64
```
Output:
```
bXktc2Vuc2l0aXZlLWRhdGE=
```

This Base64-encoded string is then placed in the `data` field of the Secret.

**YAML Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  sensitive-data-key: bXktc2Vuc2l0aXZlLWRhdGE=  # Base64-encoded 'my-sensitive-data'
```

The encoded string `bXktc2Vuc2l0aXZlLWRhdGE=` represents `'my-sensitive-data'` and is stored in the Secret.

### **3. Automatic Decoding of Secrets** <a name="3-automatic-decoding-of-secrets"></a>

When Kubernetes Secrets are consumed by a Pod or application, Kubernetes automatically decodes the Base64-encoded data back to its original form. This decoding process is handled by Kubernetes and requires no manual intervention.

For example:
- When a Secret is injected as an environment variable, Kubernetes decodes the Base64 value before passing it to the container.

### **4. Example: Consuming Secrets in a Pod** <a name="4-example-consuming-secrets-in-a-pod"></a>

Let’s see how Kubernetes automatically decodes a Secret when consumed in a Pod.

**Step 1: Create a Secret**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  sensitive-data-key: bXktc2Vuc2l0aXZlLWRhdGE=  # Base64-encoded 'my-sensitive-data'
```

**Step 2: Inject the Secret as an Environment Variable**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secret-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    env:
    - name: SENSITIVE_DATA
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: my-secret
          key: sensitive-data-key
```

In this example, Kubernetes will automatically decode the Base64 string and inject the value `'my-sensitive-data'` into the environment variable `SENSITIVE_DATA`.

**Step 3: Verify the Environment Variable**
```bash
kubectl exec secret-pod -- env | grep SENSITIVE_DATA
```
Expected Output:
```
SENSITIVE_DATA=my-sensitive-data
```

This shows that Kubernetes automatically decoded the Base64-encoded value and made it available as plain text inside the Pod.

### **5. Automatic Decoding in Other Consumption Methods** <a name="5-automatic-decoding-in-other-consumption-methods"></a>

In addition to environment variables, Kubernetes automatically decodes Secrets in other ways:

- **Volume Mounts**: When a Secret is mounted as a file inside a Pod, the Base64-encoded data is written to the file in its decoded form.
- **API Access**: When applications access Secrets via the Kubernetes API, the decoded values are passed directly to the application.

You don’t need to manually decode the data in these scenarios because Kubernetes handles it automatically.

### **6. Summary** <a name="6-summary"></a>

- **Base64 encoding** is used in Kubernetes to store sensitive data, but it is not encryption.
- Kubernetes automatically **decodes the data** when Secrets are consumed by Pods or applications, whether via environment variables, volume mounts, or API access.
- **No manual decoding** is required from your side when consuming Secrets; Kubernetes does it for you.

Understanding how Base64 encoding works with Kubernetes Secrets ensures you can securely manage sensitive information while simplifying its consumption within your applications.
