### Introduction

The External Secret Operator (ESO) allows Kubernetes to fetch secrets from cloud secret management systems like AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager (GCSM), and Azure Key Vault. By doing so, you can centralize your secret management while ensuring secrets are automatically synced into your Kubernetes cluster.

### Understanding the Flow

**Overview of the Flow**:
1. **IAM Service Account Creation**: In GCP, AWS, or Azure, a service account is created with the necessary permissions to access cloud-based secrets.
2. **Secret Store**: ESO uses a Kubernetes `SecretStore` resource to manage how Kubernetes will connect to cloud providers to fetch secrets.
3. **External Secret**: A Kubernetes `ExternalSecret` resource defines which cloud-based secret is pulled into Kubernetes as a native secret.

Each step involves critical security concepts and ensures that Kubernetes can securely retrieve the secrets.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:
- A working Kubernetes cluster with access to `kubectl`.
- AWS, GCP, or Azure account with Secret Manager API enabled.
- A basic understanding of Kubernetes secrets.

### Creating an IAM Service Account

#### 4.1 Assigning Roles and Permissions

This step covers how to create a service account with the appropriate roles and permissions to access cloud secrets.

**For GCP**:
1. **Create the Service Account**:

    ```bash
    gcloud iam service-accounts create my-secret-sa \
        --description="Service account for accessing secrets" \
        --display-name="my-secret-sa"
    ```
    > **Explanation**: This creates a service account that Kubernetes will use to securely authenticate with Google Cloud Secret Manager (GCSM).

2. **Grant Permissions**:

    ```bash
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <your-project-id> \
        --member="serviceAccount:my-secret-sa@<your-project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
        --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
    ```
    > **Explanation**: The `secretAccessor` role is granted to the service account, allowing it to retrieve secrets from GCSM.

**For AWS**:
1. **Create an IAM Policy**:

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    > **Explanation**: This policy allows the IAM role to access AWS Secrets Manager to retrieve secrets.

2. **Attach the Policy**: Attach the IAM policy to the Kubernetes worker node's IAM role.

#### 4.2 Creating and Downloading the JSON Key

After assigning permissions, create a JSON key for the service account.

**For GCP**:
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/key.json \
    --iam-account=my-secret-sa@<your-project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```
> **Explanation**: This key will be stored as a Kubernetes secret and used to authenticate the cluster with GCSM. The file is crucial for secure authentication.

### Storing Service Account Key as a Kubernetes Secret

Now that you have the service account key, youâ€™ll store it securely in Kubernetes.

**YAML File**: `gcp-secret-key.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: gcp-secret-key    # This is the name of the secret in Kubernetes
  namespace: external-secrets   # Ensure this namespace is created
type: Opaque
data:
  gcp-key.json: <base64-encoded-json-key>  # The key.json file, base64 encoded
```
**Command**:
```bash
kubectl apply -f gcp-secret-key.yaml
```
> **Explanation**: Here, we store the service account key in a Kubernetes secret. It is stored in base64 encoding for security reasons.

### Configuring the Secret Store

The Secret Store allows Kubernetes to connect to GCP, AWS, or Azure securely and retrieve secrets.

**YAML File**: `gcp-secret-store.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretStore
metadata:
  name: gcp-secrets-store  # Name of the Secret Store
  namespace: external-secrets  # Namespace where this resource exists
spec:
  provider:
    gcp:
      projectID: <your-project-id>  # GCP project ID where the secrets are stored
      auth:
        secretRef:
          name: gcp-secret-key  # The secret in Kubernetes containing the GCP service account key
          key: gcp-key.json  # Refers to the actual key in the secret
```

**Command**:
```bash
kubectl apply -f gcp-secret-store.yaml
```

> **Explanation**: This Secret Store configuration tells the External Secret Operator how to authenticate with GCSM using the service account key stored in Kubernetes. It's a necessary step for allowing Kubernetes to securely pull secrets from the external cloud provider.

### Setting Up External Secrets

The `ExternalSecret` resource is used to sync a secret from GCSM into Kubernetes.

**YAML File**: `my-external-secret.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1alpha1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: my-external-secret  # Name of the external secret in Kubernetes
  namespace: external-secrets  # Namespace where the secret will reside
spec:
  refreshInterval: "1h"  # How often the secret should be refreshed
  secretStoreRef:
    name: gcp-secrets-store  # Refers to the Secret Store we created earlier
  target:
    name: my-k8s-secret  # This is the name of the secret that will be created in Kubernetes
    creationPolicy: Owner  # Ensures Kubernetes owns and manages the secret
  data:
    - secretKey: api-key  # The key under which this secret will be stored in Kubernetes
      remoteRef:
        key: projects/<your-project-id>/secrets/my-secret/versions/latest  # Reference to the GCSM secret
```

**Command**:
```bash
kubectl apply -f my-external-secret.yaml
```

> **Explanation**: This YAML file defines an external secret in Kubernetes. It points to the cloud-based secret (in this case, GCSM) and tells Kubernetes to sync this secret into its environment. The `refreshInterval` ensures the secret is updated regularly, while the `target` specifies where the secret will reside in Kubernetes.

### Syncing and Rotating Secrets

ESO allows for automatic secret rotation. When secrets in GCSM or other cloud services are rotated, the External Secret Operator will sync the updated secret into Kubernetes based on the `refreshInterval`.

> **Important**: Ensure that your service account permissions allow secret retrieval even after secret rotation.

### Security and Encryption

Secrets stored in cloud secret managers (GCSM, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) are encrypted at rest by the cloud provider. When these secrets are synced to Kubernetes, they are base64 encoded, but not encrypted unless explicitly configured.

- **Encryption at Rest**: Managed by the cloud provider.
- **In-Cluster Security**: Secrets are base64 encoded. If further encryption is needed, consider using tools like Sealed Secrets.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Invalid Credentials**:
   - Ensure that the service account key has the proper roles and permissions

.
   - Verify that the JSON key is correctly stored in Kubernetes as a secret.

2. **Sync Errors**:
   - Use the following command to check for errors:

     ```bash
     kubectl describe externalsecret my-external-secret -n external-secrets
     ```

3. **Secret Rotation Issues**:
   - Check that your cloud provider's secret manager is configured to rotate secrets correctly.
   - Ensure the `refreshInterval` in the `ExternalSecret` YAML file is set appropriately.
