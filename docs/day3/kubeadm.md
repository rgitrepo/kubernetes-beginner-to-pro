### Kubernetes Cluster Setup with `kubeadm`

"Alright, let's talk about setting up a Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm`. First off, I want to give a shout-out to the Killer Coda website. It's honestly the best place for getting your hands dirty with Kubernetes. And the best part? You can do it all for free. You don't need to pay anything—just create an account, log in, and you’re good to go. Now, just to be clear, this isn’t a paid sponsorship or anything like that. I’m just sharing it because I’ve found it super helpful.

I’ve used Killer Coda myself, and it’s been great, especially if you’re working on CK certifications. If you’re in that boat, you probably already know about this site. It’s a fantastic resource.

Now, about `kubeadm`. There's already a cluster set up on Killer Coda using `kubeadm`, so you don’t have to worry about doing it from scratch. Just click, and boom—your cluster is created, no issues at all. 

Back in the day, before `kubeadm`, things were a bit more complicated. But honestly, you don’t need to mess around with those older methods anymore. Why? Because when you’re working with production systems, what really matters is knowing how to manage the cluster. You should be familiar with terms like `cordon`, `uncordon`, and how to drain a node. That’s what you’ll actually be doing in a real-world environment since the clusters are usually already set up for you.

I’ve spent about 25 minutes on this, so let’s move on. I’ve been reading up on how clusters are set up and the different types of clusters. It’s important to understand what a cluster really is. But hey, don’t stress about it too much. Keep it light, have some fun while you study. Seriously, don’t take it too seriously. Learning is a lot easier when you’re enjoying it."
