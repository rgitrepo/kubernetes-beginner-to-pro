### **Q1: Can we create clusters using GKE and then rely on instances for running Kubernetes? Which one is reliable for Kubernetes?**  
No, it's not recommended to run Kubernetes on instances directly (like VMs) as it's considered bad practice. The best approach is to use managed services like GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) because they provide built-in support for scaling, reliability, and management of Kubernetes clusters. Managed services take care of much of the operational overhead that you'd face when running Kubernetes on virtual instances.

### **Q2: What role does an SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) play in observability?**  
An SRE is responsible for defining thresholds for metrics, service level objectives (SLOs), service level indicators (SLIs), and service level agreements (SLAs). They work to ensure that systems are reliable, available, and meet the performance expectations. SREs play a crucial role in observability, setting up monitoring, defining when alerts should trigger, and helping teams maintain system stability.

### **Q3: Can a beginner get a job in cloud computing?**  
Yes, beginners can get jobs in cloud computing. While advanced roles like DevOps engineers may require more experience, cloud support roles or junior cloud engineer positions are available for beginners. You need to focus on gaining foundational knowledge in networking, cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), and tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.

### **Q4: Is there a simpler solution for distributed tracing?**  
Jaeger is an industry-standard tool for distributed tracing, but you can also use **Pixie** for tracing purposes. Pixie automatically collects traces, metrics, and logs from your applications with minimal configuration, making it simpler for beginners to implement compared to more complex setups like Jaeger or OpenTelemetry (OTel).

### **Q5: Why does downtime occur in Blue-Green deployment, even when creating separate environments for the new revision?**  
Downtime can occur during Blue-Green deployments for various reasons:
- **DNS Propagation:** Updating DNS records can take time, especially if your DNS provider takes longer to propagate changes globally.
- **Infrastructure Synchronization:** Even though Blue-Green deployment creates a separate environment, there might be delays in routing traffic from one environment to another, or from misconfigurations in the deployment process.
- **Load Balancer Switching:** The process of switching load balancers between environments can introduce small periods of unavailability.

### **Q6: How can downtime be reduced in Blue-Green deployments?**  
To minimize downtime:
- Use **CDNs** (Content Delivery Networks) to cache your content globally, reducing the impact of DNS propagation delays.
- Ensure your DNS provider supports **low TTL (Time to Live)** to speed up DNS propagation.
- Properly configure load balancers to seamlessly switch traffic between environments without affecting end users.

### **Q7: How can we scrape metrics in a multi-master Kubernetes cluster where all requests are routed through a front-facing API load balancer?**  
In multi-master Kubernetes clusters, metrics can be scraped in two ways:
1. **Scrape metrics from each master node individually** using a tool like **Prometheus**, which can scrape metrics from the Kubernetes API servers and controllers running on each master node.
2. Use **eBPF** (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter), which allows you to trace system calls at the kernel level, including API server calls, to reduce the overhead and directly observe network traffic.

### **Q8: Can we use eBPF to trace and monitor Kubernetes clusters?**  
Yes, eBPF is an excellent solution for tracing and monitoring Kubernetes clusters. It allows you to collect metrics and logs directly from the kernel level, which reduces the need for application-level instrumentation. Tools like **Pixie** leverage eBPF to collect telemetry data automatically, which includes network traffic, CPU usage, and memory usage.

### **Q9: What is a simple way to contribute to CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) projects?**  
To contribute to CNCF projects:
1. Start by picking an incubating project like **Pixie** or **KubeVirt** from the CNCF landscape.
2. Browse the **open issues** on GitHub for that project.
3. Look for "good first issue" labels, which are meant for beginners.
4. Once you've chosen an issue, try to resolve it, and then submit a pull request.

You don't need to directly contact CNCF itself; instead, focus on contributing to the project maintainers via GitHub.

### **Q10: How can you make boring SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) work more engaging?**  
While SRE tasks like observability, monitoring, and alerting may seem repetitive, you can make them more engaging by:
- Automating routine tasks using tools like **Backstage** or **IDP** (Internal Developer Platforms) to create smoother workflows for your teams.
- Developing new tools to simplify manual tasks, thereby improving efficiency.
- Encouraging innovation in your team by solving real-world problems related to reliability and performance.

### **Q11: Can OTel (OpenTelemetry) be used without Grafana for metric dashboards?**  
No, **OpenTelemetry (OTel)** itself is not a dashboarding tool. It’s a framework for collecting and exporting telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces). To visualize the metrics, you still need a dashboarding solution like **Grafana**. You can use OTel to gather and export metrics, but you need to integrate it with a tool like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to create dashboards.

### **Q12: How can downtime occur in DNS-based blue-green deployments?**  
Downtime can occur in DNS-based blue-green deployments due to **DNS propagation delays**. When DNS records are updated, it can take time for these changes to propagate across all DNS servers globally. Even if the infrastructure is set up correctly, the delay in DNS update propagation can cause a brief period of unavailability.

### **Q13: How can we set retention periods for metrics in Grafana or Prometheus?**  
For **Prometheus**:
- You can configure retention periods in the Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`) using the `--storage.tsdb.retention.time` flag, which defines how long Prometheus will retain metrics data.

For **Grafana** dashboards:
- Grafana doesn't store metrics directly, but it pulls them from data sources like Prometheus. You would configure the retention period on the data source (e.g., Prometheus) rather than in Grafana itself.

### **Q14: Can we generate custom metrics using tools like the Node Exporter?**  
Yes, you can generate custom metrics using the **Node Exporter** or similar tools. Node Exporter provides system-level metrics (like CPU and memory usage), but you can extend it by adding custom exporters or writing custom Prometheus exporters that expose

 your application's metrics.

### **Q15: Is Pixie capable of replacing Prometheus or OpenTelemetry?**  
No, Pixie cannot fully replace **Prometheus** or **OpenTelemetry**. Pixie provides detailed observability by using eBPF to collect data from your Kubernetes clusters. However, it complements, rather than replaces, tools like Prometheus and OpenTelemetry. For example, you can run **Pixie** alongside OpenTelemetry to gather detailed performance insights and then visualize them in **Grafana**.

### **Q16: Can eBPF be installed in a Kubernetes namespace using Helm charts?**  
No, eBPF is not installed directly using Helm charts or Kubernetes namespaces. eBPF is a kernel-level technology that’s part of the Linux kernel. To leverage eBPF, tools like **Pixie** or **Cilium** are used, which interact with the kernel and collect data. These tools can be deployed via Helm charts in Kubernetes, but eBPF itself operates at the kernel level.

### **Q17: How can we contribute to open-source projects like CNCF incubating projects?**  
You can contribute to CNCF projects by:
- Visiting the GitHub repository of incubating CNCF projects like **Pixie** or **Jaeger**.
- Looking for issues labeled as **"good first issue"** to get started.
- Working on these issues and submitting pull requests to the project maintainers.
You can also connect with other contributors via issue discussions and developer forums for collaboration.
