Yes, that's correct. In the context of Kubernetes, a DaemonSet ensures that a copy of a pod is running on all (or some) nodes in a cluster. It is often used for tasks that need to run on every node, such as logging daemons, monitoring daemons, or other background tasks. 

Here are some key points about DaemonSets in Kubernetes:

1. **Running on All Nodes**: By default, a DaemonSet runs a copy of a pod on all nodes in the cluster. This is useful for tasks that need to run across the entire cluster, like collecting node logs or monitoring node metrics.

2. **Selective Nodes**: You can configure a DaemonSet to run only on a subset of nodes using node selectors, affinities, or taints and tolerations.

3. **Automated Updates**: When you update a DaemonSet, Kubernetes will ensure that the new version of the pod is deployed on all the specified nodes.

4. **Background Tasks**: DaemonSets are ideal for background tasks that need to run continuously on all or specific nodes, ensuring they start up when the node starts and stop when the node stops.

Here's an example YAML file to create a simple DaemonSet in Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: example-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-daemonset
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example-daemonset
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: example-container
        image: busybox
        command:
        - /bin/sh
        - -c
        - "while true; do echo Hello from the DaemonSet; sleep 10; done"
```

This DaemonSet ensures that every node runs a `busybox` container that prints a message every 10 seconds.
