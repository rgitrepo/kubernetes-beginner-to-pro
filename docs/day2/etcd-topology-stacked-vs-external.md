### ETCD Topology: Stacked vs External
From the output we can see a pod for etcd, therefore the answer is Stacked ETCD. In a Stacked ETCD Topology the etcd storage cluster and the Kubernetes control plane share the same physical nodes. It contrasts with an External ETCD Topology, where etcd nodes are separate and dedicated only to running etcd, independent of the control plane nodes.
