The blog "Scaling Kubernetes to 7,500 nodes" by OpenAI highlights the challenges and solutions encountered while scaling Kubernetes clusters.

### Problems and Solutions:

1. **Networking Issues**:
   - **Problem**: Flannel's difficulties in scaling throughput.
   - **Solution**: Switched to native pod networking technologies and CNI plugins for better throughput.

2. **API Server Strain**:
   - **Problem**: High load from WATCHes on Endpoints.
   - **Solution**: Implemented EndpointSlices to reduce load.

3. **Metrics Collection**:
   - **Problem**: Prometheus memory issues and slow WAL replay.
   - **Solution**: Limited metric ingestion and applied patches to improve performance.

4. **Resource Allocation**:
   - **Problem**: Difficulty in fair resource allocation.
   - **Solution**: Introduced team taints and CPU/GPU ballooning.

5. **Scheduling Deadlocks**:
   - **Problem**: StatefulSets causing scheduling deadlocks.
   - **Solution**: Adopted the Coscheduling plugin for better scheduling.
