# Kubernetes Resource Management Tutorial

## Introduction

While you will mostly work in a declarative manner using definition files, imperative commands can help you quickly execute one-time tasks and generate resource definition templates. This approach can save considerable time, especially during exams.

### Key Options to Familiarize With

- **`--dry-run`**: By default, running a command immediately creates the resource. To test your command without creating a resource, use the `--dry-run=client` option. This will verify if the resource can be created and if your command is correct.

- **`-o yaml`**: This outputs the resource definition in YAML format, allowing you to see the configuration before actual creation.

Using these two options together can help you generate a resource definition file quickly, which you can then modify as needed.

## Creating and Managing Resources

### 1. Pods

#### Create an NGINX Pod

To create a simple NGINX Pod, run:

```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
```

#### Generate POD Manifest YAML File

To generate a manifest without creating the Pod, use:

```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

### 2. Deployments

#### Create a Deployment

To create a Deployment for NGINX, run:

```bash
kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx
```

#### Generate Deployment YAML File

To generate a Deployment definition without creating it, use:

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

#### Generate Deployment with 4 Replicas

To create a Deployment with four replicas:

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --replicas=4
```

You can also scale the Deployment using:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=4
```

Another method is to save the YAML definition to a file for modifications:

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml
```

You can then update the YAML file with replicas or any other field before creating the Deployment.

### 3. Services

#### Create a ClusterIP Service

To expose a Redis Pod as a ClusterIP Service on port 6379, run:

```bash
kubectl expose pod redis --port=6379 --name redis-service --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```bash
kubectl create service clusterip redis --tcp=6379:6379 --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

Note: The second command assumes the selector as `app=redis`, which may not work well if your Pod has a different label set. Modify the generated file as needed before creating the Service.

#### Create a NodePort Service

To expose an NGINX Pod’s port 80 as a NodePort on port 30080:

```bash
kubectl expose pod nginx --type=NodePort --port=80 --name=nginx-service --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```bash
kubectl create service nodeport nginx --tcp=80:80 --node-port=30080 --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

### Recommendation

Both commands have their challenges: one cannot accept a selector, while the other cannot accept a node port. It’s generally recommended to use the `kubectl expose` command. If you need to specify a node port, generate a definition file using the same command and manually input the node port before creating the Service.
