## **Tracee - Runtime Security with eBPF in Kubernetes**

Tracee is an eBPF-based open-source runtime security tool developed by Aqua Security, which helps track and log system calls in your Kubernetes cluster. It's particularly useful for monitoring what happens in real time within your containerized applications. This tutorial provides a detailed guide on what Tracee is, how it works, and how to configure it in your Kubernetes environment.

### **1. Introduction to Tracee**

Tracee is an open-source runtime security tool that leverages eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to track and log system calls happening inside a Kubernetes cluster. This is especially useful for monitoring system behavior and ensuring that no malicious or unintended operations are happening in your containerized environment.

Unlike traditional tools that capture system calls directly, which can be resource-intensive, Tracee operates with lower overhead by injecting code into the kernel through eBPF. This makes Tracee more efficient in real-time monitoring with reduced latency and system footprint.

### **2. Understanding eBPF and System Calls**

#### **What is eBPF?**

eBPF is a technology that allows you to run sandboxed programs in the Linux kernel without changing the kernel source code or loading kernel modules. It's used for performance monitoring, network traffic analysis, and, in the case of Tracee, runtime security.

eBPF operates in kernel space, where it can hook into various system events like system calls, network packets, or tracepoints. This capability allows tools like Tracee to monitor system activity with minimal overhead and in near-real time.

#### **How eBPF Helps in Runtime Security**

By using eBPF, Tracee can "hook" into system calls that processes inside your containers make to the kernel. These calls are tracked and logged, allowing you to monitor activities such as file access, network requests, or process execution. This is critical for detecting any unauthorized or malicious activity in your cluster.

### **3. Setting Up Tracee**

#### **Step 1: Installing Tracee**

Tracee can be installed on your Kubernetes cluster as a **DaemonSet**, ensuring that it runs on every node in your cluster. Installation is straightforward using Helm charts provided by Aqua Security.

```bash
helm repo add aqua https://aquasecurity.github.io/tracee
helm repo update
helm install tracee aqua/tracee
```

This will create a **namespace** for Tracee, **install** the required components, and run Tracee as a **DaemonSet** across your Kubernetes nodes.

#### **Step 2: Configuring Tracee DaemonSet**

Once installed, you can verify that Tracee is running as a DaemonSet by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get ds -n tracee
```

This should display the Tracee DaemonSet with all nodes running a Tracee pod. The number of pods corresponds to the number of nodes in your cluster.

For example, if your cluster has three nodes, you’ll see three Tracee pods running:

```bash
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
tracee    3         3         3       3            3           <none>          1m
```

### **4. Working with Tracee**

#### **Viewing System Call Logs**

Once Tracee is deployed, it starts capturing system calls. You can view these logs by querying the pods running Tracee on each node. To view the logs of a specific pod:

```bash
kubectl logs <tracee-pod-name> -n tracee
```

For example, if your pod is named `tracee-abcdef`, the command would look like this:

```bash
kubectl logs tracee-abcdef -n tracee
```

You’ll see a stream of system calls and events, such as:

```
TIME_STAMP   COMM           PID      TID      SYSCALL         ARGS
1627388473   curl           24519    24519    execve          ["/usr/bin/curl", "-s", "https://example.com"]
1627388473   ls             24520    24520    openat          ["/", "O_RDONLY"]
```

These logs track what system calls are being made, providing visibility into the runtime behavior of the applications.

#### **Creating Custom Policies**

By default, Tracee uses built-in event policies, but you can also create custom event policies to monitor specific system calls or behaviors.

For example, you can create a policy that tracks `execve` system calls (which are used to run new processes) and `openat` calls (which are used to open files).

A custom policy might look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: tracee-policy
  namespace: tracee
data:
  policy.yaml: |
    - event: execve
      args:
        - /usr/bin/curl
    - event: openat
      args:
        - /
```

Apply the ConfigMap to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f tracee-policy.yaml
```

Once this policy is applied, Tracee will only log events related to running the `curl` command or accessing the root directory (`/`).

### **5. Understanding the Tracee Workflow**

Here’s a typical workflow when using Tracee for runtime security:

1. **Deploy Tracee**: Install Tracee as a DaemonSet across all nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.
2. **Monitor System Calls**: Tracee will start logging all system calls made by your containers.
3. **Create Custom Policies**: Define policies to monitor specific behaviors, like process execution or file access.
4. **View Logs**: Check the logs to see which system calls are being made and detect any suspicious activity.
5. **Analyze and Respond**: Based on the logs, take action to block or mitigate potential security threats.

### **6. Conclusion**

Tracee is a powerful tool for monitoring runtime security in Kubernetes clusters. It captures system calls using eBPF, which is efficient and operates in near-real time, providing critical insights into your container’s behavior. By setting up Tracee and configuring custom policies, you can effectively monitor and secure your containerized applications without significant performance overhead.

The combination of Tracee with other security tools like **seccomp** and **capabilities** creates a robust security framework for your Kubernetes environment.
