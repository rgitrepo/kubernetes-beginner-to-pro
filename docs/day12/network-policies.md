### **5. Examples of Network Policies** <a name="policy-examples"></a>

#### **Example 1: Denying All Traffic by Default** <a name="deny-all"></a>

This policy blocks all incoming and outgoing traffic for the selected Pods:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```

**Explanation**:
- The `podSelector: {}` selects all Pods in the namespace.
- Both `Ingress` and `Egress` traffic are blocked.

To verify the applied policy and see which traffic is restricted, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl describe networkpolicy deny-all
```

**Output Example**:
```plaintext
Name:         deny-all
Namespace:    default
PodSelector:  <none> (Allowing the specific Pods to be affected)
PolicyTypes:  Ingress, Egress
Allowed Ingress: None
Allowed Egress: None
```

This command provides detailed information on the applied policy, including which types of traffic are affected and the specific rules in place. Itâ€™s very useful for debugging and ensuring that the policy behaves as expected.

<a name="question-no-policy"></a>**Interview Question**:  
- **What happens if no network policy is applied to a Pod?**
    - By default, all traffic (both ingress and egress) is allowed.

#### **Example 2: Allowing Traffic Only Between Specific Pods** <a name="allow-specific-pods"></a>

This example shows how to allow traffic between specific Pods:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend-to-backend
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
```

**Explanation**:
- The policy applies to Pods labeled as `app: backend`.
- Only Pods labeled `app: frontend` are allowed to communicate with the backend Pods.

You can use the `kubectl describe networkpolicy allow-frontend-to-backend` command to check this policy:

```bash
kubectl describe networkpolicy allow-frontend-to-backend
```

**Output Example**:
```plaintext
Name:         allow-frontend-to-backend
Namespace:    default
PodSelector:  app=backend
PolicyTypes:  Ingress
Allowed Ingress: 
  - From:
    - PodSelector: app=frontend
```

<a name="question-restrict-pod"></a>**Interview Question**:  
- **How can you restrict Pod-to-Pod communication using network policies?**
    - By applying specific network policies, such as the one above, where only selected Pods (like frontend) are allowed to communicate with backend Pods.

#### **Example 3: Restricting Traffic by CIDR Block** <a name="restrict-cidr"></a>

This example demonstrates how to use a CIDR block to restrict traffic from a specific range of IP addresses.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: restrict-cidr
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
        except:
        - 10.0.1.0/24
```

**Explanation**:
- The policy applies to Pods labeled as `app: backend`.
- It allows traffic from the CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16` except for the IP range `10.0.1.0/24`.

You can use the `kubectl describe networkpolicy restrict-cidr` command to check this policy:

```bash
kubectl describe networkpolicy restrict-cidr
```

**Output Example**:
```plaintext
Name:         restrict-cidr
Namespace:    default
PodSelector:  app=backend
PolicyTypes:  Ingress
Allowed Ingress:
  - From:
    - IPBlock: 10.0.0.0/16, except 10.0.1.0/24
```
