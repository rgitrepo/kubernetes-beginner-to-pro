Continuous Integration (CI) **does not** involve manual intervention during the process of integrating code, whereas Continuous Delivery (CD) **may or may not** involve manual intervention depending on the setup.

### **Continuous Integration (CI):**
- **What It Is**: Continuous Integration is the process where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository, typically several times a day. Each integration is automatically built and tested, ensuring that the code is valid.
- **Automation**: CI processes are highly automated. When developers push code changes to a repository, automated tools (like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or Travis CI) kick off tasks like building the code, running unit tests, and checking for code quality or security issues.
- **No Manual Intervention**: Once the code is pushed, the entire CI process runs without human involvement. The goal is to catch errors early by continuously testing and integrating the code, without requiring developers to manually verify each step.

### **Continuous Delivery (CD):**
- **What It Is**: Continuous Delivery is the practice of deploying code to a staging or production environment automatically after passing tests in the CI pipeline. However, the actual deployment to production could still require manual approval.
- **Manual Intervention (Optional)**: 
  - **With Manual Intervention**: In many organizations, Continuous Delivery might have a manual approval step before deploying to production, especially for critical systems. This ensures human oversight before new changes affect end-users.
  - **Without Manual Intervention (Continuous Deployment)**: In Continuous Deployment (which is a subset of Continuous Delivery), every change that passes automated tests is automatically deployed to production with no human intervention. This requires a highly mature, automated testing process to ensure stability.

### **Why Does Manual Intervention Occur in CD (Continuous Delivery)?**
1. **Risk Mitigation**: Many companies, especially those dealing with sensitive data or high-stakes applications (like finance or healthcare), prefer human intervention to review changes before deploying them to production. This reduces the risk of pushing faulty updates live.
2. **Compliance and Regulations**: Some industries require manual approvals for deployments to ensure compliance with legal or regulatory requirements. Having a manual checkpoint allows for a final review before deploying changes.
3. **Business Decisions**: Some updates might involve business decisions that require approval from non-technical stakeholders, making manual intervention necessary in certain cases.

### **Conclusion:**
- **CI** is fully automated with no manual intervention.
- **CD** can have manual intervention depending on the organizationâ€™s processes. In **Continuous Deployment**, no manual intervention is involved, and code is pushed automatically to production after passing all checks.
