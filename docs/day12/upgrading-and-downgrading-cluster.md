### **1. Introduction**
Upgrading or downgrading a Kubernetes cluster ensures that the cluster stays up-to-date with the latest features, security patches, and improvements. Similarly, downgrading might be necessary to revert to a more stable version if issues arise. This tutorial provides a clear guide on how to perform upgrades and downgrades using both cloud-based and `kubeadm`-based clusters, with detailed explanations for each command.

### **2. Kubernetes Versioning**
Kubernetes follows semantic versioning: `vA.B.C`, where A is the major version, B is the minor version, and C is the patch version. Minor versions are released every 3-4 months, while patches are released more frequently to fix bugs and improve security.

Example:
- Version `v1.30.2`: Major version = 1, Minor version = 30, Patch version = 2

Only the last four minor versions are supported for backward compatibility.

### **3. Why Upgrade or Downgrade?**
#### **Reasons to Upgrade:**
- **Security Fixes**: Newer versions contain essential patches.
- **New Features**: Minor versions introduce new functionalities.
- **Improved Performance**: Upgrades often come with optimizations.
  
#### **Reasons to Downgrade:**
- **Stability Issues**: Sometimes, newer versions may introduce instability.
- **Feature Deprecation**: If a feature crucial to your operation has been deprecated.

### **4. Preparation Before Upgrading/Downgrading**
1. **Backup Important Data**: Backup etcd and other critical components.
2. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure only upgrading/downgrading to supported versions (n-1, n+1 compatibility).
3. **Test in Non-Production**: Always test the process in a staging environment.
4. **Monitor the Cluster**: Enable monitoring tools to observe behavior during upgrades.

### **5. Upgrade Process**
#### **1. Upgrading Using Cloud Providers**
For clusters managed by cloud providers like GKE, AKS, or EKS, upgrades can be done easily through their user interfaces.

Example:
```bash
# Upgrade command for GKE
gcloud container clusters upgrade <CLUSTER_NAME> --master --cluster-version=<NEW_VERSION>
```

This command upgrades the cluster in GKE to the specified version.

#### **2. Upgrading Using `kubeadm`**
Clusters created using `kubeadm` require a manual upgrade process. Below is the detailed process:

1. **Check Available Versions**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-cache madison kubeadm
   # This command checks which versions of kubeadm are available for upgrade.
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```bash
   kubeadm | 1.30.2-00 | https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages
   kubeadm | 1.30.1-00 | https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages
   ```

2. **Upgrade `kubeadm` Tool**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.30.2-00
   # This updates the kubeadm package to version 1.30.2.
   ```

3. **Upgrade the Control Plane**:
   ```bash
   sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.30.2
   # This command initiates the upgrade for the control plane components.
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```bash
   [upgrade/etcd] Upgrading to etcd version v3.5.0
   [upgrade/staticpods] Writing new Static Pod manifests to "/etc/kubernetes/manifests"
   ```

4. **Upgrade the `kubelet` and `kubectl` on Each Node**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=1.30.2-00 kubectl=1.30.2-00
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart kubelet
   # This upgrades kubelet and kubectl on the node and restarts the services.
   ```

#### **3. Upgrading One Node at a Time**
It is essential to upgrade one node at a time to ensure smooth transitions and avoid overloading the system. Upgrading too many nodes simultaneously could cause service interruptions. 

1. **Why Only One Node?**
   - Upgrading one node ensures minimal disruption since the remaining nodes can continue handling traffic.
   - Avoids overwhelming the cluster by maintaining service availability.

2. **Process:**
   - **Drain and Cordon the Node**: Move all workloads off the node before upgrading.
     ```bash
     kubectl drain <NODE_NAME> --ignore-daemonsets
     # Drains the node by migrating its workloads to other nodes, but ignoring DaemonSets.
     ```

   **Output**:
   ```bash
   node/<NODE_NAME> cordoned
   evicting pod myapp-1234
   ```

   - **Upgrade the Node**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.30.2-00
     # Install the upgraded version of kubeadm on this node.
     ```

   - **Restart kubelet**:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     sudo systemctl restart kubelet
     # Restart the kubelet service to apply changes.
     ```

   - **Uncordon the Node**:
     ```bash
     kubectl uncordon <NODE_NAME>
     # After the upgrade, mark the node as schedulable again.
     ```

   **Output**:
   ```bash
   node/<NODE_NAME> uncordoned
   ```

By upgrading one node at a time, you reduce the risk of downtime and ensure a controlled upgrade process.

### **6. Downgrade Process**
The downgrade process mirrors the upgrade but must be done cautiously to avoid incompatibility. Follow similar steps to drain, install the previous version, and then restart services.

```bash
# Example of downgrading kubeadm
sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=<OLD_VERSION> kubelet=<OLD_VERSION> kubectl=<OLD_VERSION>
```

### **7. Important Concepts**
#### **1. Drain and Cordon**
- **Drain**: Move all pods from a node to other nodes in the cluster.
  ```bash
  kubectl drain <NODE_NAME> --ignore-daemonsets
  ```

- **Cordon**: Marks the node as unschedulable, preventing new pods from being scheduled.
  ```bash
  kubectl cordon <NODE_NAME>
  ```

#### **2. Kubernetes Node States**
- **Ready**: Node is ready to accept and run pods.
- **NotReady**: Node is unavailable for running pods.
- **SchedulingDisabled**: Node is cordoned and wonâ€™t accept new pods.

#### **3. Supported Versions**
Upgrading/downgrading is only supported for versions within `n-1` and `n+1`.

### **8. Common Commands, Explanations, and Outputs**
Here are frequently used commands with explanations:

- **Check Current Kubernetes Version**:
   ```bash
   kubectl version --short
   # Shows the current Kubernetes version.
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```bash
   Client Version: v1.30.0
   Server Version: v1.30.0
   ```

- **Check Available Versions for `kubeadm`**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-cache madison kubeadm
   # Lists the available versions of kubeadm.
   ```

- **Upgrade Plan for `kubeadm`**:
   ```bash


   sudo kubeadm upgrade plan
   # Shows the upgrade plan and components that will be updated.
   ```
