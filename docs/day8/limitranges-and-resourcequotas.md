### Introduction to Resource Quotas and LimitRanges

Resource Quotas and LimitRanges are essential tools in Kubernetes for managing resource consumption in a cluster. These tools help ensure fair resource allocation, prevent noisy neighbor problems, and optimize costs.

### Understanding Resource Quotas

#### What is a Resource Quota?

A Resource Quota is a tool in Kubernetes that limits the amount of resources (like CPU, memory, etc.) that can be consumed by a specific namespace. It ensures that resources are distributed fairly across different teams or applications running within a cluster.

---

#### How Resource Quotas Work

Resource Quotas work by enforcing a maximum limit on resource consumption at the namespace level. If a namespace tries to exceed its allocated resources, the Kubernetes scheduler will prevent any further resource consumption, ensuring fair usage across the cluster.

#### Applying Resource Quotas in Kubernetes

To apply a Resource Quota, you need to define a YAML file that specifies the limits for various resources like CPU and memory. The Resource Quota can only be applied at the namespace level, not at the cluster-wide level.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

---

#### Resource Quota YAML Example

Here’s an example of a Resource Quota YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: example-quota
  namespace: example-namespace
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "1"
    requests.memory: "1Gi"
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: "2Gi"
```

This YAML file defines a Resource Quota for a namespace called `example-namespace`. It limits the CPU requests to 1 core and memory requests to 1GiB, while setting the CPU limit to 2 cores and memory limit to 2GiB.

---

#### Resource Quota Application and Output

Once the Resource Quota is applied using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f resource-quota.yaml
```

You can verify its implementation by checking the Resource Quotas in the namespace:

```bash
kubectl get resourcequotas -n example-namespace
```

**Expected Output:**

```plaintext
NAME            AGE
example-quota   2m
```

You can also describe the Resource Quota to see the detailed usage:

```bash
kubectl describe resourcequota example-quota -n example-namespace
```

**Expected Output:**

```plaintext
Name:           example-quota
Namespace:      example-namespace
Resource        Used  Hard
--------        ----  ----
limits.cpu      0     2
limits.memory   0     2Gi
requests.cpu    0     1
requests.memory 0     1Gi
```

This output shows that the Resource Quota has been successfully applied and the current resource usage is within the specified limits.

### LimitRanges in Kubernetes

#### What are LimitRanges?

LimitRanges are a Kubernetes feature that sets minimum and maximum resource usage constraints (CPU, memory, etc.) for each pod or container in a namespace. This ensures that no single pod or container consumes excessive resources, potentially starving other applications.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

---

#### How LimitRanges Function

LimitRanges are applied at the pod or container level within a namespace. They enforce resource limits, ensuring that each pod or container operates within the defined boundaries. This helps prevent resource contention issues within a namespace.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

---

#### LimitRange YAML Example

Here’s an example of a LimitRange YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: example-limitrange
  namespace: example-namespace
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "512Mi"
    defaultRequest:
      cpu: "250m"
      memory: "256Mi"
    type: Container
```

This YAML file defines a LimitRange for a namespace called `example-namespace`. It sets default resource limits of 500m CPU and 512MiB memory, with default requests of 250m CPU and 256MiB memory per container.

---

#### Implementing LimitRanges and Output

Apply the LimitRange using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f limitrange.yaml
```

You can list the LimitRanges in the namespace using:

```bash
kubectl get limitranges -n example-namespace
```

**Expected Output:**

```plaintext
NAME               CREATED AT
example-limitrange 2m
```

To see the details of the LimitRange, you can use:

```bash
kubectl describe limitrange example-limitrange -n example-namespace
```

**Expected Output:**

```plaintext
Name:         example-limitrange
Namespace:    example-namespace
Type          Resource  Min   Max  Default Request  Default Limit  Max Limit/Request Ratio
----          --------  ---   ---  ---------------  -------------  -----------------------
Container     cpu       -     -    250m             500m           -
Container     memory    -     -    256Mi            512Mi          -
```

This output shows that the LimitRange has been successfully applied, and any new containers created in this namespace will adhere to these resource constraints.

### Integration of Resource Quotas and LimitRanges

#### Resource Quotas at the Namespace Level

Resource Quotas are applied at the namespace level, ensuring that the total resource consumption within a namespace does not exceed defined limits. This is crucial for multi-tenant environments where different teams or applications share the same cluster resources.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

---

#### LimitRanges at the Pod Level

LimitRanges operate at the pod or container level, ensuring that individual pods or containers within a namespace do not consume more resources than they should. This prevents resource contention within a namespace, making sure that all applications run smoothly.

#### Example of Combined Resource Quota and LimitRange

In many production environments, both Resource Quotas and LimitRanges are applied together to ensure optimal resource allocation and prevent resource conflicts. Here’s an example of applying both in the same namespace:

```yaml
# resource-quota.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: combined-quota
  namespace: example-namespace
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "1"
    requests.memory: "1Gi"
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: "2Gi"

# limitrange.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: combined-limitrange
  namespace: example-namespace
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "512Mi"
    defaultRequest:
      cpu: "250m"
      memory: "256Mi"
    type: Container
```

Apply these files using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f resource-quota.yaml
kubectl apply -f limitrange.yaml
```

This setup ensures that the namespace as a whole cannot exceed the resource limits defined in the Resource Quota, while each pod or container adheres to the constraints set by the LimitRange.
