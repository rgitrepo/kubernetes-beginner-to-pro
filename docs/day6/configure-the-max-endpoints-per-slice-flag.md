To configure your Kubernetes cluster to handle up to 1,000 endpoints per slice, you need to modify the `kube-controller-manager` component by setting the `--max-endpoints-per-slice` flag. This is done by adjusting the Kubernetes controller manager’s deployment configuration, typically found in the YAML file responsible for managing this component.

### Practical Steps to Configure the `--max-endpoints-per-slice` Flag

1. **Locate the `kube-controller-manager` Deployment:**
   - The `kube-controller-manager` is usually deployed as a static pod in your cluster, especially in managed environments like Kubeadm. The YAML file for this pod is typically found in the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/` directory on the control plane nodes.
   - If your setup uses a different method (e.g., a custom deployment), the location might vary. In such cases, consult your cluster's deployment configuration or cloud provider documentation.

2. **Modify the YAML File:**
   - Open the YAML file responsible for the `kube-controller-manager` static pod. This file is usually named something like `kube-controller-manager.yaml`.
   - Find the section that lists the command-line arguments for the `kube-controller-manager`.

3. **Add the `--max-endpoints-per-slice` Flag:**
   - Add the `--max-endpoints-per-slice` flag and set its value to `1000` within the command arguments section.

### Example YAML Configuration

Here’s how the `kube-controller-manager.yaml` might look after adding the `--max-endpoints-per-slice` flag:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kube-controller-manager
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  containers:
  - name: kube-controller-manager
    image: k8s.gcr.io/kube-controller-manager:v1.20.0
    command:
    - kube-controller-manager
    - --allocate-node-cidrs=true
    - --cluster-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
    - --service-cluster-ip-range=10.96.0.0/12
    - --use-service-account-credentials=true
    - --max-endpoints-per-slice=1000           #updated to 1000
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /etc/kubernetes/pki
      name: k8s-certs
      readOnly: true
  hostNetwork: true
  volumes:
  - hostPath:
      path: /etc/kubernetes/pki
    name: k8s-certs
```

### Where to Find the YAML File

- **Location:** The YAML file for the `kube-controller-manager` is typically located at `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` on the control plane node(s) of your Kubernetes cluster.
- **Access:** You’ll need root or sudo access to modify this file. SSH into the control plane node and navigate to the specified directory to edit the file.

### Applying the Changes

1. **Save the File:** After modifying the YAML file, save your changes.
2. **Kubernetes Will Automatically Restart the Pod:** The Kubernetes system will automatically detect the change in the manifest file and restart the `kube-controller-manager` pod with the new configuration.
