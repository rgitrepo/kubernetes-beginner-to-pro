### **Introduction to Ingress & Ingress Controller**
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

Ingress is a key concept in Kubernetes that allows external HTTP and HTTPS traffic to access services within the cluster. It acts as a bridge between external requests and internal services, enabling more advanced routing capabilities compared to a simple Load Balancer.

#### **Ingress**:
- **Function**: Ingress is responsible for defining the rules that match incoming requests to services within your Kubernetes cluster. These rules often include domain names and paths. For example, you can configure an Ingress to direct requests with a specific domain name (like `example.com`) or URL path (like `/app1`) to a particular service within your cluster.
  
  - **Example**: An Ingress resource might specify that requests to `app1.example.com` should be routed to the `app1-service`, and requests to `app2.example.com` should go to the `app2-service`.

#### **Ingress Controller**:
- **Function**: The Ingress Controller is responsible for implementing the rules defined in the Ingress resources. It watches for Ingress resources and configures the underlying infrastructure (such as NGINX or cloud load balancers) to route the traffic based on the Ingress rules.
  
  - **How It Works**: When a request comes in, the Ingress Controller checks the rules defined in the Ingress resource. It then directs the traffic to the appropriate service within the Kubernetes cluster, based on the domain name, path, or other criteria.

#### **To summarize**:
- **Ingress** defines *which* services should be matched based on specific domain names and paths.
- **Ingress Controller** makes sure that traffic is *routed* correctly according to the rules specified in the Ingress, effectively acting as the "traffic director."

### **Deploying a Load Balancer**
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

In Kubernetes, a Load Balancer is typically deployed to manage incoming traffic. However, it's important to note that the IP address of the Load Balancer can change if it is deleted and recreated. This is because Kubernetes assigns an ephemeral IP by default.

**Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: MyApp
```

---

### **Static IP vs. Ephemeral IP**
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

While ephemeral IPs are commonly used, some organizations may opt for a static IP, especially when they require consistent IP addresses for their services. However, using static IPs can be costly and is typically reserved for organizations with specific needs or larger budgets.

---

### **Ingress Overview**
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

Ingress in Kubernetes acts as a bridge between external requests and the internal services. Unlike a Load Balancer, which might directly expose a service, an Ingress can provide advanced routing and can be used to expose multiple services under a single IP address.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Ingress Resource**: Defines the routing rules.
- **Ingress Controller**: Implements the routing by interpreting the Ingress resource.

---

### **Creating and Configuring an Ingress Controller**
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

To use Ingress, you must first deploy an Ingress Controller. The Ingress Controller listens to the Ingress resources and fulfills the routing rules.

**Example:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```
This command installs the NGINX Ingress Controller using a predefined YAML configuration.

---

### **Ingress Architecture**
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

The Ingress architecture typically involves an end-user, a web application firewall (WAF), a load balancer, and the Ingress Controller. The Ingress Controller handles routing based on the rules specified in the Ingress resource.

**Example Architecture:**
```
End-User -> WAF or Load Balancer -> Ingress Controller -> Service
```

---

### **Path-Based, Domain-Based, and Geolocation-Based Routing**
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

Ingress supports various routing methods, including path-based, domain-based, and geolocation-based routing. These methods allow you to direct traffic to different services based on URL paths, hostnames, or even geographic location.

#### **Path-Based Routing**
Path-based routing allows you to route traffic to different services based on the URL path.

**Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: "example.com"
      http:
        paths:
          # Requests to example.com/app1 will be routed to the app1-service
          - path: /app1
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: app1-service
                port:
                  number: 80
          # Requests to example.com/app2 will be routed to the app2-service
          - path: /app2
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: app2-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

#### **Domain-Based Routing**
Domain-based routing allows you to route traffic to different services based on the requested domain name or subdomain.

**Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: domain-routing-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    # Requests to app1.example.com will be routed to the app1-service
    - host: "app1.example.com"
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: app1-service
                port:
                  number: 80
    # Requests to app2.example.com will be routed to the app2-service
    - host: "app2.example.com"
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: app2-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

#### **Geolocation-Based Routing (Conceptual)**
Geolocation-based routing directs traffic based on the user's geographic location. While Kubernetes Ingress doesn't natively support geolocation-based routing, this can be achieved using external tools or services like a geo-aware load balancer (e.g., AWS Route 53, Cloudflare).

**Example (Conceptual)**:
If using an external service, you could define geolocation rules that route traffic to different Kubernetes Ingress Controllers based on the user's location.

```yaml
# This is a conceptual example; actual implementation depends on the external tool used
geoRouting:
  US-East:
    service: us-east-service
  Europe:
    service: eu-service
  Asia:
    service: asia-service
```

In this conceptual example, traffic from users in the US would be routed to the `us-east-service`, while traffic from Europe would be routed to the `eu-service`.

### **Creating an Ingress Resource**
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

Creating an Ingress resource involves defining the rules that will direct incoming traffic to the appropriate services.

**Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: "myapp.com"
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```
This YAML file creates an Ingress resource that routes traffic from `myapp.com` to `my-service`.

---

### **Ingress Troubleshooting**
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

Ingress troubleshooting can involve checking logs, ensuring the correct ingress class is defined, and verifying the Ingress resource's configuration.

**Common Issues:**
- **Missing Ingress Class**: Ensure the `ingressClassName` is correctly specified.
- **404 Errors**: This could be due to misconfigured paths or backend services.

**Example:**
```bash
kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx $(kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx -o name)
```
Check logs for any issues with the Ingress Controller.

---

### **Advanced Topics: Custom Domains and Certificates**
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

You can map custom domains to your services using Ingress and secure them with

 SSL certificates. This typically involves creating an A-record in your domain registrar and configuring the Ingress resource to use the certificate.

**Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: secure-ingress
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - "myapp.com"
      secretName: myapp-cert
  rules:
    - host: "myapp.com"
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```
