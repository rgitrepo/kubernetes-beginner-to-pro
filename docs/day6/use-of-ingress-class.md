### Use of IngressClass

The `IngressClass` in Kubernetes is a resource that defines the controller that should implement an Ingress resource. Essentially, it tells Kubernetes which Ingress controller should handle the traffic rules defined in your Ingress resource.

#### Key Points about IngressClass:

1. **Controller Selection**: An `IngressClass` allows you to specify which Ingress controller (e.g., NGINX, Traefik) should manage the Ingress resource. Different Ingress controllers might have different capabilities and configurations. By specifying the `IngressClassName` in your Ingress resource, you ensure that the correct controller processes the traffic routing.

2. **Multiple Controllers**: In environments where multiple Ingress controllers are running, `IngressClass` is crucial for distinguishing which controller should manage which Ingress resources. This is especially important in complex deployments where different applications might require different types of traffic management.

3. **Custom Behavior**: With `IngressClass`, you can define custom behavior for specific types of traffic routing. For example, you might have one Ingress controller for external HTTP traffic and another for internal services. `IngressClass` allows you to direct traffic appropriately based on these needs.

### Why Not Having `IngressClass` Causes an Issue

If an `Ingress` resource does not specify an `IngressClass` and there's no default `IngressClass` set up, Kubernetes will not know which Ingress controller should manage the resource. This causes several issues:

1. **Controller Ambiguity**: Without an `IngressClass`, Kubernetes is unable to determine which controller should handle the Ingress resource. This can lead to situations where the traffic routing rules are not applied at all, resulting in errors like 404 when trying to access the service.

2. **Failure to Apply Traffic Rules**: The Ingress resource's rules (such as routing HTTP traffic to specific services) won't be applied if Kubernetes doesn't know which controller to use. This failure can render the Ingress resource ineffective, causing the application to be inaccessible.

3. **Potential Conflicts**: In environments with multiple Ingress controllers, not specifying an `IngressClass` can lead to conflicts where multiple controllers might attempt to process the same Ingress resource or, conversely, none may process it at all. This lack of clarity can lead to unpredictable behavior in how traffic is routed.

### Summary

The `IngressClass` is essential for directing Kubernetes on which Ingress controller to use for handling traffic defined in an Ingress resource. Without it, Kubernetes cannot correctly apply traffic rules, leading to accessibility issues for your application and potential conflicts in environments with multiple controllers.
