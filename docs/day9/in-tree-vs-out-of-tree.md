In Kubernetes, "in-tree" refers to components, plugins, or drivers that are built directly into the Kubernetes core codebase. These in-tree components are maintained and released as part of the main Kubernetes project. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what this means:

1. **In-Tree Plugins/Drivers**:
   - These are integrated directly into Kubernetes' source code. For example, certain storage provisioners, network plugins, or cloud provider integrations were historically developed as in-tree components.
   - Since they are part of the core Kubernetes code, they are tightly coupled with the Kubernetes release cycle. Any changes, updates, or bug fixes to these in-tree plugins are done through Kubernetes itself and require Kubernetes upgrades.

2. **Migration to Out-of-Tree**:
   - Kubernetes has been migrating many in-tree plugins and drivers to "out-of-tree" models. Out-of-tree components are developed, maintained, and released separately from the core Kubernetes project.
   - The reason for this shift is to decouple these plugins from the Kubernetes release cycle, allowing for more flexibility in development and updates.

3. **In-Tree vs. Out-of-Tree**:
   - **In-Tree**: Part of the Kubernetes core, tightly integrated, and released with Kubernetes.
   - **Out-of-Tree**: Developed and maintained independently, allowing for faster iteration and flexibility without waiting for Kubernetes releases.

The shift from in-tree to out-of-tree models is particularly significant in areas like cloud provider integrations and storage provisioners, where Kubernetes aims to reduce the dependency on its core codebase for better modularity and maintainability.
