### Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Tutorial

**Objective**: This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes, including its configuration, use cases, and practical examples. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to configure and manage RBAC for your Kubernetes clusters effectively.

### 1. [Introduction to RBAC](#introduction-to-rbac)

**RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control) in Kubernetes is a method for controlling access to the Kubernetes API based on the roles assigned to users or service accounts. Each role consists of rules that define the permissible actions on resources within the cluster.

### 2. [Authorization Modes in Kubernetes](#authorization-modes-in-kubernetes)

Kubernetes supports several authorization modes, which determine how access is granted within the cluster:

- **AlwaysAllow**: Grants access to every request made to the API server. This mode is generally used in non-production environments or for auditing purposes.
- **AlwaysDeny**: Denies all requests, typically used for clusters that store sensitive information and need to ensure no unauthorized access.
- **RBAC**: This mode allows the use of RBAC for fine-grained control over who can do what within the cluster.
- **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**: This older method provides a more flexible but less structured approach than RBAC, where access is granted based on policies defined in a file.

#### Example of Configuring Authorization Mode

To configure the authorization mode in Kubernetes, you typically need to edit the API server configuration file located at `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml`. The relevant section of the file might look like this:

```yaml
- --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC
```

In this example, `Node` and `RBAC` modes are enabled. The API server checks authorization using these modes in left-to-right order.

### 3. [Core Components of RBAC](#core-components-of-rbac)

RBAC in Kubernetes revolves around four main components:

#### 3.1. [Roles and ClusterRoles](#roles-and-clusterroles)

- **Roles**: Define permissions within a specific namespace.
- **ClusterRoles**: Define permissions cluster-wide.

#### 3.2. [RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings](#rolebindings-and-clusterrolebindings)

- **RoleBindings**: Grant the permissions defined in a Role to a user or service account within a namespace.
- **ClusterRoleBindings**: Grant the permissions defined in a ClusterRole to a user or service account across the entire cluster.

##### Example Role YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

##### Example RoleBinding YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: my-namespace
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: jane
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

### 4. [Creating and Applying Roles and Bindings](#creating-and-applying-roles-and-bindings)

Roles and bindings can be created and applied using `kubectl` commands or by applying YAML manifests. Here is how you can create a role and bind it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f role.yaml
kubectl apply -f rolebinding.yaml
```

To verify that the role and binding were created successfully, you can use:

```bash
kubectl get roles -n my-namespace
kubectl get rolebindings -n my-namespace
```

### 5. [Wildcard Usage in RBAC](#wildcard-usage-in-rbac)

Wildcards can be used in RBAC to grant permissions broadly:

- `*` in the `resources` field grants permissions on all resources.
- `*` in the `verbs` field allows all actions (e.g., get, create, update).

**Example**: Granting a user full access to all resources:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  name: admin
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
```

### 6. [Validating RBAC Configurations](#validating-rbac-configurations)

To validate whether a specific action is allowed under a given role, Kubernetes provides the `kubectl auth can-i` command.

**Example**:

```bash
kubectl auth can-i create pods --as=jane -n my-namespace
```

This command checks whether the user `jane` can create pods in the `my-namespace`.

### 7. [Best Practices for RBAC](#best-practices-for-rbac)

- **Least Privilege**: Always assign the least privilege necessary. Use RoleBindings rather than ClusterRoleBindings where possible to limit the scope.
- **Namespace Isolation**: Use namespaces to isolate resources and permissions.
- **RoleBinding Over ClusterRoleBinding**: Prefer RoleBindings to limit permissions to a specific namespace rather than across the entire cluster.

### 8. [Troubleshooting and Common Errors](#troubleshooting-and-common-errors)

- **401 Unauthorized**: This error indicates that the user is not authenticated.
- **403 Forbidden**: This indicates that the user is authenticated but does not have permission to perform the action.
- **Invalid Role or Binding**: Ensure that roles are created before bindings and that the role names and namespaces match.

**Example** of troubleshooting command:

```bash
kubectl describe rolebinding read-pods -n my-namespace
```

This command will show you the details of the RoleBinding, helping to identify any misconfigurations.
