### 1. [Introduction to RBAC](#introduction-to-rbac)

**RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control) in Kubernetes is a method for controlling access to the Kubernetes API based on the roles assigned to users or service accounts. Each role consists of rules that define the permissible actions on resources within the cluster.

### 2. [Authorization Modes in Kubernetes](#authorization-modes-in-kubernetes)

Kubernetes supports several authorization modes, which determine how access is granted within the cluster:

- **AlwaysAllow**: Grants access to every request made to the API server. This mode is generally used in non-production environments or for auditing purposes.
- **AlwaysDeny**: Denies all requests, typically used for clusters that store sensitive information and need to ensure no unauthorized access.
- **RBAC**: This mode allows the use of RBAC for fine-grained control over who can do what within the cluster.
- **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**: This older method provides a more flexible but less structured approach than RBAC, where access is granted based on policies defined in a file.

#### Example of Configuring Authorization Mode

To configure the authorization mode in Kubernetes, you typically need to edit the API server configuration file located at `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml`. The relevant section of the file might look like this:

```yaml
- --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC
```

In this example, `Node` and `RBAC` modes are enabled. The API server checks authorization using these modes in left-to-right order.

**Explanation of `authorization-mode=Node,RBAC`:**

- **Node**: This mode is used to authorize kubelets. It ensures that each node in the cluster has access only to the API resources necessary to manage its own workloads and nothing more.
- **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control mode allows defining granular access controls for users and service accounts.

**Significance of Left-to-Right Evaluation**:

- The modes are evaluated in the order they are listed, from left to right. This means that when a request comes to the API server, it first checks the `Node` authorization mode. If the request is authorized by this mode, the API server does not evaluate the subsequent modes.
- If `Node` authorization does not allow the request, the server then checks `RBAC` to see if the request can be authorized. 

**Tweaking to Read Right-to-Left**:

- By default, Kubernetes processes the authorization modes from left to right, but with some custom configurations or by modifying the order in the `kube-apiserver.yaml`, it could potentially prioritize modes differently. However, this is not typical and should be approached with caution as it may lead to unexpected behavior.

For instance, if you wanted to prioritize RBAC before Node, you would configure it as:

```yaml
- --authorization-mode=RBAC,Node
```

In this case, the RBAC rules would be checked first before the Node mode, which may have implications depending on how you manage permissions within your cluster.

### 3. [Core Components of RBAC](#core-components-of-rbac)

RBAC in Kubernetes revolves around four main components:

#### 3.1. [Roles and ClusterRoles](#roles-and-clusterroles)

- **Roles**: Define permissions within a specific namespace.
- **ClusterRoles**: Define permissions cluster-wide.

#### 3.2. [RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings](#rolebindings-and-clusterrolebindings)

- **RoleBindings**: Grant the permissions defined in a Role to a user or service account within a namespace.
- **ClusterRoleBindings**: Grant the permissions defined in a ClusterRole to a user or service account across the entire cluster.

##### Example Role YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

In this example, the `Role` named `pod-reader` is defined to allow the `get`, `watch`, and `list` actions on `pods` within the `my-namespace`.

##### Example RoleBinding YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: my-namespace
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: jane
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

The above `RoleBinding` grants the `pod-reader` role to a user named `jane` in the `my-namespace` namespace.

### 4. [Creating and Applying Roles and Bindings](#creating-and-applying-roles-and-bindings)

Roles and bindings can be created and applied using `kubectl` commands or by applying YAML manifests. Here is how you can create a role and bind it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f role.yaml
kubectl apply -f rolebinding.yaml
```

To verify that the role and binding were created successfully, you can use:

```bash
kubectl get roles -n my-namespace
kubectl get rolebindings -n my-namespace
```

### 5. [Wildcard Usage in RBAC](#wildcard-usage-in-rbac)

Wildcards can be used in RBAC to grant permissions broadly:

- `*` in the `resources` field grants permissions on all resources.
- `*` in the `verbs` field allows all actions (e.g., get, create, update).

**Example**: Granting a user full access to all resources:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  name: admin
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
```

### 6. [Validating RBAC Configurations](#validating-rbac-configurations)

To validate whether a specific action is allowed under a given role, Kubernetes provides the `kubectl auth can-i` command.

**Example**:

```bash
kubectl auth can-i create pods --as=jane -n my-namespace
```

This command checks whether the user `jane` can create pods in the `my-namespace`.

### 7. [Best Practices for RBAC](#best-practices-for-rbac)

- **Least Privilege**: Always assign the least privilege necessary. Use RoleBindings rather than ClusterRoleBindings where possible to limit the scope.
- **Namespace Isolation**: Use namespaces to isolate resources and permissions.
- **RoleBinding Over ClusterRoleBinding**: Prefer RoleBindings to limit permissions to a specific namespace rather than across the entire cluster.

### 8. [Troubleshooting and Common Errors](#troubleshooting-and-common-errors)

- **401 Unauthorized**: This error indicates that the user is not authenticated.
- **403 Forbidden**: This indicates that the user is authenticated but does not have permission to perform the action.
- **Invalid Role or Binding**: Ensure that roles are created before bindings and that the role names and namespaces match.

**Example** of troubleshooting command:

```bash
kubectl describe rolebinding read-pods -n my-namespace
```

This command will show you the details of the RoleBinding, helping to identify any misconfigurations.
