The `-` at the end of the command is significant because it instructs `kubectl` to read input from **standard input (stdin)** rather than expecting a file. Here's why it's necessary in this context:

### Command Breakdown:
1. **Without the final `-`:**
   ```bash
   curl -L https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/latest_release/weave-daemonset-k8s-1.11.yaml | kubectl apply -f
   ```
   - `kubectl apply -f` expects a file path or URL as the next argument. Since no file path or URL is provided after `-f`, the command fails with an error like:
     ```
     error: --filename (-f) is required
     ```

2. **With the final `-`:**
   ```bash
   curl -L https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/latest_release/weave-daemonset-k8s-1.11.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
   ```
   - The `-` tells `kubectl` to accept the input directly from the pipe (stdin), where the YAML content streamed by `curl` is being passed.
   - `kubectl apply -f -` effectively processes the YAML content coming from `curl` as if it were reading it from a file.

### Key Role of `-`:
- It acts as a placeholder indicating that `kubectl` should process the input directly from the output of `curl`, enabling commands like these to work seamlessly in a pipeline.
- Without the `-`, `kubectl` doesn't know what input to use for the `-f` flag, leading to a failure.

### Why Does the Pipe Require `-`?
Pipelines (`|`) pass data from the stdout of one command (`curl`) to the stdin of another (`kubectl`). The `-` in this case explicitly tells `kubectl` to read its input from stdin, which is necessary when chaining commands like this.

### Additional Notes:
- If the YAML file was downloaded locally, you could avoid using `-` by providing the file path:
  ```bash
  curl -L -o weave-daemonset.yaml https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/latest_release/weave-daemonset-k8s-1.11.yaml
  kubectl apply -f weave-daemonset.yaml
  ```
- Alternatively, you could pass the URL directly to `kubectl` if supported, eliminating the need for `curl`:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/latest_release/weave-daemonset-k8s-1.11.yaml
  ```
