## Network Plugin in Kubernetes


There are several plugins available, and these are some.

### 1. Weave Net:

To install,

```
kubectl apply -f
```

https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v2.8.1/weave-daemonset-k8s.yaml

You can find details about the network plugins in the following documentation :

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/#networking-and-network-policy

### 2. Flannel :

To install,

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/2140ac876ef134e0ed5af15c65e414cf26827915/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
```

Note: As of now, flannel does not support Kubernetes network policies.

3. Calico :

### To install,

```
curl https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml -O
```

Apply the manifest using the following command.

```
kubectl apply -f calico.yaml
```

Calico is said to have the most advanced cni network plugin.

In the CKA and CKAD exams, you wonâ€™t be asked to install the cni plugin. But if asked, you will be provided with the exact URL to install it.

**Note: If there are multiple CNI configuration files in the directory, the kubelet uses the configuration file that comes first by name in lexicographic order.**


The `-` at the end of the command is significant because it instructs `kubectl` to read input from **standard input (stdin)** rather than expecting a file. Here's why it's necessary in this context:

### Command Breakdown:
1. **Without the final `-`:**
   ```bash
   curl -L https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/latest_release/weave-daemonset-k8s-1.11.yaml | kubectl apply -f
   ```
   - `kubectl apply -f` expects a file path or URL as the next argument. Since no file path or URL is provided after `-f`, the command fails with an error like:
     ```
     error: --filename (-f) is required
     ```

2. **With the final `-`:**
   ```bash
   curl -L https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/latest_release/weave-daemonset-k8s-1.11.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
   ```
   - The `-` tells `kubectl` to accept the input directly from the pipe (stdin), where the YAML content streamed by `curl` is being passed.
   - `kubectl apply -f -` effectively processes the YAML content coming from `curl` as if it were reading it from a file.

### Key Role of `-`:
- It acts as a placeholder indicating that `kubectl` should process the input directly from the output of `curl`, enabling commands like these to work seamlessly in a pipeline.
- Without the `-`, `kubectl` doesn't know what input to use for the `-f` flag, leading to a failure.

### Why Does the Pipe Require `-`?
Pipelines (`|`) pass data from the stdout of one command (`curl`) to the stdin of another (`kubectl`). The `-` in this case explicitly tells `kubectl` to read its input from stdin, which is necessary when chaining commands like this.

---

### Additional Notes:
- If the YAML file was downloaded locally, you could avoid using `-` by providing the file path:
  ```bash
  curl -L -o weave-daemonset.yaml https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/latest_release/weave-daemonset-k8s-1.11.yaml
  kubectl apply -f weave-daemonset.yaml
  ```
- Alternatively, you could pass the URL directly to `kubectl` if supported, eliminating the need for `curl`:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/latest_release/weave-daemonset-k8s-1.11.yaml
  ```
