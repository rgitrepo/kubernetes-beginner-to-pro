To view the **latest logs** when using the `journalctl -u kubelet` command, you can use the `-n` and `-f` options:

### 1. **Using `-n` to display the last few lines of logs**
   The `-n` option shows the last **n** lines of logs. For example:
   ```bash
   journalctl -u kubelet -n 50
   ```
   This will display the last 50 lines of the kubelet logs.

### 2. **Using `-f` to follow the logs in real-time**
   The `-f` option works like `tail -f`, showing the logs as they are written. For example:
   ```bash
   journalctl -u kubelet -f
   ```
   This will continuously stream the latest kubelet logs to your terminal.

### 3. **Combining `-n` and `-f` for context**
   If you want to start by viewing the last few lines and then follow the logs, you can combine both options:
   ```bash
   journalctl -u kubelet -n 50 -f
   ```
   This will show the last 50 lines of logs and then continue displaying new logs as they are generated.

These options provide flexibility depending on whether you want a snapshot of recent logs or continuous log monitoring.
