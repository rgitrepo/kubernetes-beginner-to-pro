### **Introduction**
Deploying applications effectively is critical for ensuring their stability, availability, and performance. The choice of deployment strategy should be guided by several key factors to minimize risk and ensure seamless updates. This tutorial will walk you through three crucial questions you must ask before selecting a deployment strategy, and how these questions shape your deployment decisions.

### **What is Your Business Use Case?**
#### **Defining Business Use Case**
A business use case describes the purpose and importance of the application being deployed. It answers questions like:
- Is the application a banking service, stock trading platform, gaming application, or a SaaS product?
- How critical is the application's availability to the business?

These factors will dictate the level of risk you can take during deployment and the downtime that can be tolerated.

#### **Choosing a Deployment Strategy Based on Business Use Case**
Depending on the criticality of the application, different deployment strategies may be more appropriate:
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Suitable for applications where some downtime is acceptable. This strategy involves running two environments (blue and green), switching traffic from one to the other during deployment.
- **Canary Deployment**: Used when you want to minimize risk by rolling out the deployment to a small subset of users before a full rollout.
- **Rolling Update**: Commonly used when you need to update the application without taking it offline. This strategy updates the application in stages, maintaining availability throughout the process. It's also the default update strategy if none is specified.

If the application is highly critical (e.g., financial services), a strategy that ensures zero downtime, such as a rolling update or a sophisticated canary deployment, would be preferred.

### **What is Your Error Budget?**
#### **Understanding Error Budget**
An error budget is the amount of allowable downtime or failure in a system within a given period. It's calculated based on Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and the system's historical performance.

- **High Error Budget**: Allows for more aggressive deployments, including possibly riskier strategies like blue-green, where downtime is involved.
- **Low Error Budget**: Requires more conservative strategies, focusing on minimizing any potential downtime or disruption, such as canary deployments or rolling updates.

#### **Impact of Error Budget on Deployment**
Your deployment strategy should align with the available error budget. If previous releases have consumed much of the error budget, it might be wise to choose a safer strategy that ensures minimal impact, like a rolling update. On the other hand, if the error budget is largely unused, there may be room to experiment with more rapid deployment methods.

### **What is the Application Architecture?**
#### **Importance of Application Architecture**
The complexity of the application’s architecture can significantly impact the deployment strategy. For instance:
- Does the application involve multiple databases?
- Is it a microservices-based application with several interdependent services?

Understanding the architecture helps in planning the deployment, especially in coordinating updates across different components.

#### **Deployment Considerations for Complex Architectures**
For complex architectures, such as those with multiple databases or microservices, it's essential to plan the deployment in a way that avoids breaking dependencies:
- **Sequential Deployment**: Where components are updated in a specific order to maintain system integrity.
- **Staggered Rollout**: Updating different parts of the architecture in phases, allowing for monitoring and rollback if issues arise.

A clear understanding of the architecture will ensure that the deployment strategy chosen does not inadvertently cause failures or service interruptions.

### **Conclusion**
Choosing the right deployment strategy is a balance between understanding the business use case, error budget, and the application’s architecture. By asking the right questions and thoroughly evaluating these factors, you can select a deployment strategy that aligns with your business needs and technical constraints.
